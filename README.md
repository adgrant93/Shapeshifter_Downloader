A simple script to pull down the entirety or part of shapeshifter by Lemonfontcomics :)

Running the program is simple but requires multiple steps. I made this in about 3 days so its not super smart but it gets the job done :)

Linux/MacOS:

1. Creat 5 folders for parts 1-5 and place them in your Downloads folder
2. Download the get_shapeshifter.py file and place a copy of it inside of each of the part folders
3. Open the terminal (Mac: Command+Space > type 'terminal' Linux: Ctrl+Alt+T is the typical shortcut. Otherwise search for it amongst your programs)
4. type the following command:
  cd ~/Downloads
  cd <name of your part folder>
  i.e. My folder is called "part_1" for part 1 lol. So I typed "cd ~/Downloads" "cd part_1"
5. type the following:
  python3 get_shapeshifter.py
6. The program has instructions on how to run it :)


Windows:

You will need to install python3 (you can get it from the MS app store super easy download).

The same process as above applies. I have not tested it in windows yet because my main machines are Linux and MacOS, but it should work the same as the application is OS agnostic.
